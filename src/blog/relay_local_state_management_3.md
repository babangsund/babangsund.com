Every great movie series, is a triology.  
This is a law and thus, there are no exceptions.

1. [Introduction - writing a controlled input](/relay_local_state_management)  
2. [Global state - controlling the drawer](/relay_local_state_management_2)  
3. *You are here*.

If you're unfamiliar with state managment using Relay, I recommend you take the time to read part 1 and 2, first.
