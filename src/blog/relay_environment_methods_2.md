[In my previous post](/relay_environment_methods/), I revealed a set of [Relay](https://relay.dev/) Environment methods.

In this post, I will explain how to use them together by walking through an example.  
We will re-create the `useLocalQuery` hook, from the [react-relay-local-query](https://github.com/babangsund/react-relay-local-query) repository.
